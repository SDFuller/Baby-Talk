Baby E is only a month and 2 weeks old. 
Already her neck strength has improved so much since birth and can hold her head up for 3 minutes,
but she isn't fond of being on her tummy for long. She likes to "coo" and grunt but she also has a wild temper when she doesn't get what she wants...
Baby E is exclusively breastfeed so she is with her mommy for a good portion of the day when she isn't napping or wanting to be played with.
Her dad is super in love with Baby E and thinks she is the best little jellybean.
